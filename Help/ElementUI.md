## Core-level methods

### Promoted

```python
DestroyElement()
```
Destroys the Widget.

```python
EditCustomName(name)
```
Change the name of the slider in the custom entry (maintains original name intact).

```python
GetPresetsManager()
```
Returns the deply dependable dictionary that holds presets.

```python
Reorder(name, source, receiver)
```
Reorder widgets.

```python
SetDefaultValue()
```
Set the slider to the range and value found on creation (original value on dragging of parameter).

### Pattern selection

Each method selects the element's pattern type and sets that type's values in one call. Values
are kept per type on the element's `Patterndata` parameter, so switching type and back
preserves what you entered. Written to the model, never to the controls, so they work
whether or not the pane is pointed at this element.

```python
SetPseq(sequence=[0.25, 0.5, 1.0])
```
Play the sequence in order, looping.

```python
SetPrand(sequence=[0.25, 0.5, 1.0])
```
Pick from the sequence at random.

```python
SetPxrand(sequence=[0.25, 0.5, 1.0])
```
Pick at random with no immediate repeats.

```python
SetPshuffle(sequence=[0.25, 0.5, 1.0])
```
Shuffle the sequence once, then loop it.

```python
SetPwrand(sequence=[0.25, 0.5, 1.0], weights=[0.33, 0.33, 0.33])
```
Pick at random, biased by the weights.

```python
SetPseries(start, step=1, length=10)
```
Arithmetic series. Finite, so the engine wraps it to repeat.

```python
SetPgeom(start, grow=2, length=10)
```
Geometric series. Finite, so the engine wraps it to repeat.

```python
SetPwhite(lo=0.0, hi=1.0)
```
Uniform random values between `lo` and `hi`.

```python
SetPbrown(lo=0.0, hi=1.0, step=0.01)
```
Brownian motion bounded by `lo` and `hi`.
