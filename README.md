# TDMorph 3.2 (BUILD IN PROGRESS... TO BE OFFICIALLY RELEASED VERY SOON)

Note that there are various differences with previous versions. Please refer to this [video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIXt53QVFt8&ab_channel=TouchDesigner) from minute 37, where I explain in detail what those are.

## What is TDMorph?

**TDMorph** is a toolbox designed to enhance **parametric exploration**, **preset storage**, **composition**, and **cueing** within the **TouchDesigner** platform.

It facilitates the creation and performance of **generative content** through various methods, while allowing you to **archive and recall parameter configurations** using a flexible **JSON-based format**.

In addition, TDMorph includes a set of **developer tools** for building **custom systems**, making it a versatile resource for artists and technical creators alike.


## What can I do with it?

With **TDMorph**, you can perform a wide range of operations for creative exploration, performance, and system design in **TouchDesigner**, including:

1. **Random search** for parameter states across one or multiple nodes.  
2. **Morphing between states** using various interpolation curves.  
3. **Store and retrieve** an unlimited number of presets.  
4. **Control parameters and transitions** through automatically generated UIs.  
5. **Automatically store, randomize, and transform** parameters of any node.  
6. **Auto-learn MIDI and OSC** mappings for every UI control.  
7. **Script full UI behavior** via high-level Python commands.  
8. **Set global and local timing** for each parameter independently.  
9. **Automatically generate animations** from stored presets.  
10. **Build flexible cueing systems** with follow actions and quantization.  
11. **Generate parameter patterns** programmatically using the *Patterns* library.  
12. **Create algorithmic cueing systems** through scripting.

And much more!

## How does it work?

The architecture of **TDMorph** is fully modular, allowing you to use its core functionality either as a unified system or as individual components. This flexibility lets you combine different approaches depending on your needs.  
The three main modes of operation are:

- **PresetManager**  
  A UI-less core component that manages any number of nodes simultaneously. It serves as the backbone of the engine‚Äîideal for advanced developers who want to build their own systems from scratch.

- **ParameterMorpher**  
  A node with an interactive interface that includes widgets and control buttons, allowing you to easily perform morphing, randomization, and parameter operations across multiple nodes.

- **SceneLauncher**  
  A high-level UI designed for show control. It enables you to organize and trigger scenes and presets, supports follow actions, and integrates seamlessly with cue-based workflows.

## Tutorials

**TDMorph** is a powerful and versatile tool ‚Äî while it may take some time to explore its depth, the basic functionality is intuitive and easy to grasp.

### Overview

Here a quick overview of the main tools to give you a quick idea. 

#### Preset Manager

UI-less node to store, recall, and morph parameter states across multiple TouchDesigner nodes. The core of the TDMorph architecture.

#### Parameter Morpher

A powerful drag-and-drop front end for generating automatic UIs, enabling morphing, preset management, and aleatoric parameter exploration ‚Äî fully

#### Scene Launcher

A minimalistic controller for cueing and managing scenes from arbitrary presets, featuring follow actions, randomization, and versatile tools for intuitive scene sequencing.

# Shortcuts

The **TDMorph** ecosystem includes a set of simple, intuitive shortcuts designed to streamline your workflow. You only need to remember a few combinations ‚Äî all built around the keys:

<kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Mouse Button</kbd>

That‚Äôs it! Every shortcut in TDMorph is derived from these two simple modifiers.

## ElementsContainer

### When clicking on a preset slot

- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left Click</kbd> ‚Äî Store a preset  
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Click</kbd> ‚Äî Delete a preset  
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Middle Click</kbd> ‚Äî Freeze a preset  
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Left Click</kbd> ‚Äî Jump to preset (no interpolation)  
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Right Click</kbd> ‚Äî Morph to preset in 1 second (for quick transition checks)

### When clicking on an element‚Äôs name

- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left Click</kbd> ‚Äî Reset element to its original value (on creation)  
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Click</kbd> ‚Äî Rename element

### When clicking on a container‚Äôs name

- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Right Click</kbd> ‚Äî Rename container

### When clicking on empty space within an element‚Äôs container

- <kbd>Right Click</kbd> ‚Äî Open a context menu with various available actions


## ScenesLauncher

### When clicking on empty space within the Scene Launcher

- <kbd>Right Click</kbd> ‚Äî Open a context menu with various available actions


## MIDI and OSC

### When either is enabled

- <kbd>Left Click</kbd> ‚Äî Activate auto-learning (waits for a MIDI or OSC input to map)  
- <kbd>Right Click</kbd> ‚Äî Assign the parameter to the detected MIDI or OSC signal  
- <kbd>Middle Click</kbd> ‚Äî Remove the MIDI or OSC mapping


## Code documentation

## Patterns

Since version 2, **TDMorph** includes a **Patterns** library ‚Äî inspired by the *homonymous* system in the **SuperCollider** language. Originally, *Patterns* were conceived in SuperCollider as *‚Äúa rich and concise score language for music.‚Äù*  
You can read more about this concept here: [SuperCollider Practical Guide](https://doc.sccode.org/Tutorials/A-Practical-Guide/)

The motivation behind this library was the need for a powerful **value generation system** within TouchDesigner. Rather than a direct port, this implementation is a **reverse-engineered adaptation** of SuperCollider‚Äôs original Patterns system ‚Äî built from the ground up using Python‚Äôs **generators** and **lazy evaluation** capabilities.

The result is a flexible and expressive framework for **algorithmic pattern generation**, designed to integrate seamlessly with the **TDMorph** toolkit and the **TouchDesigner** environment.
